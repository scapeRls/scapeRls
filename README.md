I enjoy working in open-source environments and constantly challenge myself to improve my coding skills across various languages. Currently, I'm diving deeper into blockchain development, automation, and system administration.

### What I'm Focused On:
- **Linux**: Daily use and management of Linux systems 🖥️, with a strong focus on scripting and automation 🔧.
